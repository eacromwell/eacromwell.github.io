# Salary Analysis
## Project 3
### Project Summary:
As we begin to consider roles in data analytics, we decided to research some of the factors contributing to salary disparities. Our research investigates the relationship between salary and key variables,  age, education level, years of experience, gender, and job title. 

We created an interactive dashboard featuring multiple visualizations referencing the source data and consisting of:

- GIFs
- Bar Charts
- Line Graphs
- Scatter Plots

Each visualization contains multiple views and can be filtered for insights.

The dashboard was uploaded to GitHub Pages at eacromwell.github.io/index.html

### Project Outline:
For Project 3, you will work with your group to tell a story using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:

1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
2. Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:
    - A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
    - A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
    - A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
