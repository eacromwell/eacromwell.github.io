          <h2><b>Group 3 - Project 3</b></h2>
          <h2><b>Exploring the relationship between Salary Gender, Age, Education Level, Experience and Role</b></h2>
          <h3>For our project, we wanted to study factors that can affect a salary. This information is relevant to those in the Data Analytics Bootcamp because most of us will apply for new jobs once the boot camp ends. Knowing which job titles offer better pay will be helpful during the job search. We also can use our insights to negotiate a higher salary during the hiring process.</h3>
            <p><h3>We have all heard of the gender wage gap and were interested in seeing how true that is for this data set. We also assumed that salary would increase as age, education level, and years of experience increase, but we wanted to ensure that these assumptions were correct. </h3></p>
            <p><h3><b>Note: In the sourced dataset, sample responses for "Gender" were limited to "Male" or "Female". As gender selection options expand in the workforce, our hope is that the relevant data becomes more widely available.</b></h3></p>

            <p>For both genders, the highest salary was for “Director of Data Science,” which is good news for us, as we are entering the field of data analytics.</p></h3>

          <h3>When comparing salaries to age, it is clear that salary tends to increase as age increases. <p>This correlation is unsurprising because with age comes more experience and promotion opportunities.</p> <p>In addition, salaries can increase from less than <b>$40k at age 22</b> to more than <b>$180k at age 60</b> - a whopping <b>$140k increase</b> throughout a career.</p></h3>

              <p> When analyzing Salary Increase Amount, there was greater disparity between genders. For example, Female <b>Marketing Coordinators</b> received a <b>$55,000</b> increase vs <b>$30,000</b> for their male counterparts.
